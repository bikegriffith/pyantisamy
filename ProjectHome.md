Based on the initial work done in the OWASP AntiSamy Project, this project aims to bring comprehensive XSS prevention to Python developers.

The methodology of AntiSamy is unique in that it is built on a positive security model in both the format of the HTML document and the content within the document. It's also unique in that it attempts to help the user tune their input to pass validation in a cooperative spirit, rather than treating users as potential attackers which is how all contemporary security mechanisms work.
